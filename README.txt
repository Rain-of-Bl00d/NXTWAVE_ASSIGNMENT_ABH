"""
radius (R) → Main loop radius.
width → Width of the strip.
resolution → Number of points for smoothness.
Create a grid of (u, v) values using np.linspace and np.meshgrid.
Compute 3D Coordinates
Use the parametric equations:
x = (R + v * cos(u/2)) * cos(u)
y = (R + v * cos(u/2)) * sin(u)
z = v * sin(u/2)
This gives the (x, y, z) points for the surface.
Calculate Surface Area
Compute partial derivatives (∂x/∂u, ∂x/∂v, etc.) using np.gradient.
Find the cross product of tangent vectors (∂r/∂u × ∂r/∂v).
Integrate its magnitude using Simpson’s rule (double integral over u and v).
Compute Edge Length
Extract the boundary points (top and bottom edges).
Sum the Euclidean distances between consecutive points.
Visualize the Möbius Strip
Use matplotlib to plot the surface (plot_surface).
Customize with colors and labels."""
